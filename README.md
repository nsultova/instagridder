### Instagridder

Small basic tool I wrote mimicking instagrams new grid layout (5:4 ratio) to create different previews of art arrangements.
As artist on social media this is sadly the reality and all the tools out there claiming to ease your life whilst eating that frog
are bloated with ads and other questionable behaviors.

List of tools used(so far):

* [Python](https://python.org): web server
  * [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/): web server
  * [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/): HTML templates
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/): CSS framework for the front-end style
* [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript): for drag&drop 

####Notes
This is still very basic as I needed a quick-fix and further littered with notes-to-self comments as I am rather new to the whole web-dev thing. Still trying to keep it neat and useful <3

Wanna-Do: Might turn this into an actual tool with simple ui and proper data deletion
